            Network graphs, also known as graphs or simply networks, are a fundamental concept used in mathematics and various fields to represent and analyze connections between different entities.
            Consider a group of distinct points, which we call nodes, and these nodes are interconnected by lines known as edges. These edges effectively depict the relationships, interactions, or dependencies that exist between the nodes.
            <br>
            </br>
            Network graphs find applications in a wide range of fields. In computer science, they're used to model connections in computer networks or the structure of websites. In social sciences, they help analyze relationships within groups of people. In biology, they can model interactions between molecules or species. Telecommunications relies on network graphs to optimize data transmission. These graphs provide a versatile way to understand the complex web of connections that underlie various systems and phenomena.
            <br>
            </br>
            Here, network graph was used to visualize the relationships between characters, movies, and actors in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) because it is an effective way to represent complex interconnections and dependencies between various entities.
            <h3>
                The Objectives: 
            </h3>
            1. <strong>Data Acquisition</strong>: Perform web scraping using Python and also parsing data using ChatGPT to gather comprehensive data about characters, movies, and actors from the MCU directly from Wikipedia and IDMB.
            <br></br>
            2. <strong>Data Cleaning</strong>: The initial step involves preprocessing the acquired data usnig Numpy(python), pandas(python) & EXCEL to address various issues such as missing values and inconsistencies. Cleaning the data ensures that the subsequent analysis and visualization are accurate and reliable.
            <br></br>
            3. <strong>Feature Engineering & Data transformation</strong>: The next stage involves two key tasks. First, feature engineering is carried out to select and craft relevant features that will be used as inputs for the analysis. These features help capture the essence of the MCU's intricate relationships. Second, data transformation steps are applied. This includes normalizing(by applying appropriate mathematical formulas), scaling, and refining the data to enhance visualization and prepare it for effective utilization in subsequent analyses.
            <br></br>
            4. <strong>Network Visualization</strong>: Utilize the scraped data to create an interactive network graph that visually represents the relationships between characters, movies, and actors.
            <br></br>
            5. <strong>Narrative Communication</strong>: The next stage involves two key tasks. First, feature engineering is carried out to select and craft relevant features that will be used as inputs for the analysis. These features help capture the essence of the MCU's intricate relationships. Second, data transformation steps are applied. This includes normalizing, scaling, and refining the data to enhance visualization and prepare it for effective utilization in subsequent analyses.
             <br></br>

             <h3>
                The Back story:
            </h3>

            It all starts with a hint of confusion. In the vibrant world of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), where superheroes soar and epic stories unfold, I found myself in a moment of uncertainty. 
            Questions swirled in my mind: 
            
            <br></br><strong>Were certain characters really part of specific movies? </strong>
            <br></br>
                
            <strong>Which character played a role in which film?</strong>
            <br></br>
            To brng clarity to my curiosity, I set out with determination to bring a full stop for my quetsions.
            <br /><br />
            With the passion of a true MCU enthusiast, I ventured into data realm of data acquisition.
            <br /><br />
            My mission was clear: to unearth comprehensive information about characters, movies, and actors directly from the pages of Wikipedia and IDMB.
            <br /><br />
            However it was not a easy job to bring raw data to life in the form of Network graphs. The data I collected was a mosaic of facts, sprinkeled with missing details & inconsistencies.To lay a foundation for my exploration, I began with a vital step: data cleaning. 
            <br /><br />
            With a cleaned dataset in hand, I stepped into the realm of feature engineering and data transformation. I handpicked the elements that held the key to unlocking the MCU's secrets: characters, movies, and actors. Like pieces of a puzzle, I fit them together to create a clear picture. 
            To enhance the visualization and ensure accuracy, I scaled and refined the data, preparing it for the next phase of my journey.
            <br /><br />
            The time had come to breathe life into the data and let the MCU's web of connections shine. Armed with the power of network visualization, I conjured an interactive graph that laid bare the relationships between characters, movies, and actors. Nodes representing characters and movies emerged, connected by lines that told stories of collaborations and appearances. 
            The visualization wasn't just lines and nodes; it was a vibrant tapestry that painted the MCU's intricate landscape.
            <br /><br />
            Prior to visualizing my data, I created instances of each to discover the most fitting tool. During this exploration, I delved into the offerings of various options, including sigma.js, D3, Plotly, networkX, three.js, Viz network, and network D3. Each tool had its own set of advantages and drawbacks. After dedicating a substantial amount of time to this evaluation process, I ultimately opted for Viz network.
            This decision was driven by the fact that Viz network encompassed a richer array of features compared to the other libraries and tools.
            <br /><br />
            Yet, a story is more than just visuals; it's an experience. As I navigated the graph, I felt a sense of discovery and connections. 
            Each interaction was a piece of a puzzle, bringing me closer to understanding the woven threads of the MCU's narrative.
            <br /><br />
            With my exploration complete, I embraced the final chapter of my journey: narrative communication. The web of characters and movies that once puzzled me now became a story to tell. Using the interactive graph as my canvas, I wove a tale that celebrated the interconnected nature of the MCU
             
         <br></br>So, from a simple moment of confusion, a captivating journey emerged. Through data acquisition, cleaning, feature engineering, data transformation, network visualization, and narrative communication, I uncovered the magic of the MCU. What began as a puzzle ended as a tapestry of wonder that showcased the depth and beauty of a cinematic universe that will forever captivate the imagination of fans like me.
